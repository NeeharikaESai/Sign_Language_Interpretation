 AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE
 A natural language in linguistics and philosphophy language subjects can be defined as a language that has been developed
 by means of usage, culture and communities naturally over time. The American Sign Language comes under the category of the 
 same. The American Sign Language serves as a prevalent sign language for the deaf communities in the United States. It 
 was devised in the early 19th century in the American School of Deaf in Connecticut. A reliable source estimates a range 
 of 250,000 to 500,000 ASL users in the United States. Due to obvious reasons, communities of the disabled are often treated
 poorly. Keeping this is mind, we have created a project based on American Sign Language Interpretation.

 The main aim of this project is to track the gestures made by the hand in American Sign Language and translate it into English language.
 The entire project has been coded in Python language for its versatility and is open to new ideas and suggestions for 
 researchers and code enthusiasts thereby creating it as an open source project.
